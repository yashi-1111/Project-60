        <p>An old man lived in a village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy. He constantly complained and was always in a bad mood. The longer he lived the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him  because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others. But one day when he turned eighty years old an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour that the Old Man is happy today. He is smiling and even his face is freshened up. The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked: What happened to you? He replied: Nothing special. For Eighty years I've been chasing happiness  and it was useless. Now I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That is why I am happy now. Moral of the story is Dont chase happiness. Enjoy your life.

        <p>A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument and one friend slapped the other one in the face.The one who got slapped was hurt but without saying anything, he wrote in the sand- today my best friend slapped me in the face. They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone- Today my best friend saved my life. The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him; I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now you write on a stone, Why? The other friend replied: When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it. Moral of the story: Don't value the things you have in your life. But value who you have in your life.</p></div>
